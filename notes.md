Aa React application that creates a simple blogging interface where users can input information to create blog posts.

App Component (App.js):
This is the main component that serves as the entry point of your application. It imports the Blog component and renders it within the App component. This is a functional component written using an arrow function.

Blog Component (Blog.js):
This component is responsible for managing the state of the blog posts. It uses the useState hook to manage the state of author, title, content, and a list of listOfPosts. It also defines a function addToList that is used to add new blog posts to the list.

The return block of the Blog component renders several things:

It renders a UserInput component to capture the user's input for creating a new blog post.
It renders a BlogPost component that receives the addToList function and the state variables for title, author, and content as props. This component handles the submission of the new post.
It uses the map function to iterate over the listOfPosts array and renders each individual blog post by displaying its title, author, and content.
BlogPost Component (BlogPost.js):
This component is responsible for rendering the form that allows users to input information for a new blog post. It receives several props from the Blog component: addToList, title, setTitle, author, setAuthor, content, and setContent.

The handleSubmit function is triggered when the user submits the form. It creates an object with the provided author, title, and content, and then calls the addToList function to add the new post to the list.

UserInput Component (UserInput.js):
This component is used to render the input fields for creating a new blog post. It receives props for title, setTitle, author, setAuthor, content, and setContent. It sets up input fields for the title, author, and content of the new blog post. When users type into these input fields, the corresponding state variables in the Blog component are updated.

The general flow of the application is as follows:

The user interacts with the UserInput component to input the title, author, and content of a new blog post.
The user submits the form, triggering the handleSubmit function in the BlogPost component.
The handleSubmit function constructs a new blog post object and sends it to the addToList function in the Blog component.
The addToList function updates the listOfPosts state with the new post, causing the Blog component to re-render and display the updated list of posts.
